# Quality Assurance Guidelines for MudBlazor CRM Application

## Overview

This document outlines the quality assurance (QA) processes and guidelines for the MudBlazor CRM application to ensure reliable releases and prevent broken updates.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- **Framework**: xUnit with .NET 8.0
- **Coverage**: All business logic, models, and services
- **Location**: `MudBlazorCrmApp.Tests` project
- **Standards**:
  - Minimum 80% code coverage for new features
  - All public methods must have corresponding tests
  - Use descriptive test names following `MethodName_Scenario_ExpectedResult` pattern
  - Include edge cases and error conditions

### Test Categories
1. **Model Tests**: Validate data models and relationships
2. **Service Tests**: Test business logic and service methods
3. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions (to be added)
4. **API Tests**: Validate REST endpoints (to be added)

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run tests with coverage
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"

# Run tests in specific configuration
dotnet test --configuration Release
```

## Build & Deployment Pipeline

### Continuous Integration
The GitHub Actions workflow includes:
- **Multi-version testing**: Tests on both .NET 8.0 and 9.0
- **Build validation**: Ensures successful compilation
- **Automated testing**: Runs complete test suite
- **Code quality checks**: Static analysis and formatting validation
- **Security scanning**: Placeholder for security tools

### Quality Gates
Before deployment, all of the following must pass:
- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] Build succeeds without errors
- [ ] Code quality checks pass
- [ ] Security scans complete without critical issues

### Deployment Requirements
- Deploy only occurs after successful build and test execution
- Deployment requires passing code quality gate
- Only .NET 8.0 artifacts are deployed (for compatibility)

## Code Quality Standards

### Formatting
- Use EditorConfig for consistent formatting
- Follow C# coding conventions
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Include XML documentation for public APIs

### Warning Treatment
- Treat warnings as errors in Release builds
- Address all nullable reference warnings
- Fix deprecated API usage warnings
- Resolve MudBlazor analyzer warnings

### Version Compatibility
- Primary target: .NET 8.0 for maximum compatibility
- Test compatibility with .NET 9.0 for future-proofing
- Use compatible package versions across all projects

## Pre-Release Checklist

Before releasing any update:
- [ ] All tests pass locally and in CI
- [ ] Code has been reviewed by another developer
- [ ] Breaking changes are documented
- [ ] Version numbers are updated appropriately
- [ ] Release notes are prepared
- [ ] Database migrations (if any) are tested
- [ ] Performance impact has been assessed

## Security Considerations
- Regularly update dependencies
- Scan for known vulnerabilities
- Validate all user inputs
- Use secure authentication practices
- Follow OWASP security guidelines

## Performance Monitoring
- Monitor application performance after deployments
- Set up alerts for critical failures
- Track key metrics (load times, error rates)
- Conduct performance testing for major releases

## Issue Resolution Process
1. **Reproduce**: Confirm the issue in a test environment
2. **Test**: Create failing test that demonstrates the issue
3. **Fix**: Implement minimal fix to resolve the issue
4. **Verify**: Ensure test passes and no regressions introduced
5. **Document**: Update relevant documentation

## Tools and Resources
- **IDE**: Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio Code
- **Testing**: xUnit, Moq, coverlet
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Code Quality**: Built-in analyzers, EditorConfig
- **Documentation**: Markdown files in repository
